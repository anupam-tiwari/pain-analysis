limit any other remedies that BBRI may have for the default 
of End User under this Agreement nor relieve End User of 
any of its obligations incurred prior to such termination.  

6. Miscellaneous.
6.1. Entire Agreement; Severability; Waiver.  

This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the 
parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, 
with respect to the matters covered by this Agreement.  If any 
of the provisions of this Agreement is held by a court of 
competent jurisdiction to be invalid under any applicable 
statute or rule of law, such provision shall, to that extent, 
be deemed omitted, and the remaining portions of this Agreement 
shall remain in full force and effect.  The waiver of a breach 
or default or any delay in exercising any rights shall not 
constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.  
The headings are for convenience and shall not be used to 
construe this Agreement.

6.2. Governing Law. 

This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by the laws 
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without reference to its 
principles of conflicts of laws.  Both parties acknowledge and 
agree that the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods shall not apply to the license of the Software 
hereunder.  All disputes arising under, out of, or in any way 
connected with the Software or this Agreement shall be 
litigated exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting 
in Boston, Massachusetts.  Each party stipulates that the courts
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall have personal 
jurisdiction over its person, and hereby irrevocably (i) 
submits to the personal jurisdiction of said courts and (ii)
consents to the service of process, pleadings, and notices in 
connection with any and all actions initiated in said courts 
and waives any objection to venue.  The parties agree that a 
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and binding and may be enforced in any other 
jurisdiction.
